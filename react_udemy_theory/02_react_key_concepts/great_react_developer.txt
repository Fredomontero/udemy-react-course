How to be a great React developer?

1.- Decide on components:
    - How do we build this reusable components?
    - How much do we break down a component?
2.- Decide the satte and where it lives
    - This state can live in different locatiosn in our DOM, where should it be? we have to place the state in the appropiate compoennt.
3.- What changes when state changes?
    - We have to decide what part of the virtual DOM we want to change, because it can take a huge impact on performance.
