The third key concept of React is:

    UNIDIRECTIONAL DATA FLOW

So far we understand that React allows us to write more JavaScript to make page more dynamic, and create components to build SPA like with Lego blocks and that it has a state that we have to update so React can update the template.

Reacts uses a Virtual DOM which is a JavaScript representation of the DOM. Then React compares the Virtual DOM vs the actual DOM, so lets say that the user clicks a logging button, the state will change and React reacts to that change and say: 'hey, combine the new state and the components we have and update the DOM'.
