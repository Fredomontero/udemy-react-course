So far we have created our first reducer, and after that we create our rootReducer where we will combine all our reducers.
But we need to create our store, so in our React folder, we create a file called store.js ans we import this:

    import{ createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'

so if we remember we need add middleware to our store, so when whatever actions gets fired or dispatched, we can catch them and display them

import logger from 'redux-logger';
import rootReducer from './root-reducer';

const middlewares = [logger];
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(...middlewares))

export default store;

Finally we need to import our store into index.js and pass it as an argument in the Provide Component:

import store from './redux/store'

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <BrowserRouter>
            <App />
        </BrowserRouter>
    </Provider>,
     document.getElementById('root')
);

Then we need to create our ActionCreator functions, we need to create them in a file called user.actions.js

export const setCurrentUser = user => ({
    type: 'SET_CURRENT_USER',                    <---This is the reducer types expectation
    patload: user
})
