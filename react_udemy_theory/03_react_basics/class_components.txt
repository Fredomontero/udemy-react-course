The reason of using  class component is that by using class components we have access to the state, which is a JavaScript object with many properties.
in order to do that we need to use it as follows:

class App extends Componet{
    constructor(){
        super()
        
        this.state = {
            string: 'Hello Montero'
        }
    }
}

super in the constructor calls the constructor method on the component clas and gives us access to the state, and then we can set it to something.

On Linux I had  a problem with the watchers, since I'm using the npm start command that has been configured by create-react-app, the problem was related with the default number of watchers available for the system, I found the solution here:

running this command:  echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
