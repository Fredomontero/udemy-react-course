So far the responsible of listing the list of mosnters is the App component, but we want to pass that responsibility to the CardList component, so lets do that:

render(){
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <CardList monsters={this.state.monsters}/>>
      </div>
    )
  }

  Now, in our App component we only attached our CardList component and we pass the monsters as a property, then in the CardList Component:

  export const CardList = (props) => {
    return(
        <div className='card-list'>
            { props.monsters.map( monster => (
                <Card key={monster.id} monster={monster}/>
            ))}
        </div>
    );
}

We attached our Card component inside the map method, so in each iteration it will create a new Card component, then we pass a single monster as a property:

export const Card = (props) => {
    return(
        <div class='card-container'>
            <img alt="monster" src={`https://robohash.org/${props.monster.id}?set=set2&size=180x180`}/>>
            <h1>{ props.monster.name }</h1>
            <p>{ props.monster.email }</p>
        </div>
    )
}

Finally in our Card component we display the properties of each monster
