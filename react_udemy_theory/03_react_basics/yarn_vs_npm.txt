Using NPM or yarn is a personal choice. We can use this as a guide for the different two commands we can use:

Install dependencies from package.json:

    npm install == yarn

Install a package and add to package.json:

    npm isntall package --save ==  yarn add package

Install a devDependency to package.json:

    npm install package --save-dev == yarn add package --dev

Remove a dependency from package.json:

    npm uninstall package --save == yarn remove package

Upgrade a package to its latest version:

    npm update --save == yarn upgrade

Install a package globally:

    npm install package -g == yarn global add package
