React has Synthetic events, for example for the native HTML onchange event:

- The user types something on a searchField and the 'onchange' event is triggered
- Then the virtualDOM intercepts that event and says, let me tell my React app that something has changed

And that's a synthetic event, kind of fake event that pretends to be the native event. We use them to detect whenever a DOM event happens.
