Why do we need to break everything into components instead of having a huge JSX file where we hace all our code?

Question: When and why do we break things down into components?

- To let each component have only one responsibility
- For readibility
- Its easier to mantain and debug

We make things more flexible, the bigger a component is, the more logic that it has, makes more difficult to reuse it in another place 
thats why break thing into pretty small component files is very important, also the flexibility of component performance.
Separate components into concerns.
